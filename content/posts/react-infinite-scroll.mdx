Load data progressively as user scrolls down with minimal coding. 
Skip to the The Front End section if you already have a backend available. 
Both backend and front end code is available on GitHub.

## The Backend
For this demo we need a backend which is capable of handling paging controls. we are using spring boot with the following dependencies:
spring-boot-starter-data-rest : Exposes repositories as Rest Endpoints
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa : For creating repositories
h2 : embedded database for quick start

This is another paragraph after the code block.

## This is a secondary heading

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```
